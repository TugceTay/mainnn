    RDNAP makes the rdtrans2008.gsb and naptrans.gtx grid correction files freely available.
    Implementation and distribution of the rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid and naptrans2008 VDatum-grid in
    combination with other tools/software that require these grids for transformation between ETRS89 and
    RD/NAP is allowed, under the following conditions:
    1. It is not allowed to modify the correction values of the grid correction files. (It is allowed to
       convert the grid data to a different file format or data structure as long as this does not affect
       the results of the calculations.)
    2. It should be clear from the documentation of the software using the grid correction files that
       the transformation procedure using the grid correction files is not identical to
       RDNAPTRANSTM2008.
    3. The correct implementation of the grid corrections has to be tested as specified in Appendix 2
